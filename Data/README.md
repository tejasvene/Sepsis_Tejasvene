(a)1_GeneAnnotated subdirectory contains Gene expression file data that has been preprocessed, normalized and annotated with gene name
(b)2_Cell_Predictions subdirectory contains raw cell composition predictions obtained from GEDIT for each selected cohorts
(c)3_CellcompositionData subdirectory contains cell composition data predictions obtained from GEDIT upon appending Metadata information such as age, gender, infection type
(d)Cleaned_CellTypePredictionsWithMetadata.tsv - is the cell composition predictions with Metadata information after combining the 7 cohorts. It is cleaned of missing values and information that is not within the scope of the study.
